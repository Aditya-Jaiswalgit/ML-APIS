## 22 Nov 2025 – random depot notes

Some updates from around the depot today. KMRC-012 seems to have some election-related branding still on it.
Marketing Dept said it’s priority 1, valid since starting of the month (1 Nov) and continuing till the end (30 Nov).
High visibility coaches needed as per them.

Also heard KMRC-004 has some tourism posters, but it’s lower priority (maybe lvl 2?).
Ops team approved it. I think the wrapping is only outside, not inside. Should last mid-Nov (around 15th) up to mid-Dec (roughly 15th).

Cleaning updates:
• Train 012 should get its quick daily clean sometime late night, around 11 PM to 11:45 PM. Team A is handling it. Status: scheduled.

• KMRC-019 is already under detailing… started around 10 PM and will probably continue past midnight till 1 AM. “Detail Squad” team is on it. Currently in progress.
